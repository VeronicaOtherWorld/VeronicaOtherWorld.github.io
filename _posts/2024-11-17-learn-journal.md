It is a **cloudy day** as well. My mood is not too good, but I am keeping learning Java at home on Sunday. So crazy, I love studying knowledge and solving new challenges.  

The teacher of the course I am learning is Shunping Han. A brilliant Chinese Java teacher. He is so patient and well experienced. When I follow him to code, he gives me a lot of idea and thoughts.  

For instance,  while we coding, we should focus on a pieces of code, to maintain robustness and reduce coupling.  

Today, I have finished the chapter 9, a small house rent system. I canâ€™t wait to move forward with the program!  

Here is the link of this application.
