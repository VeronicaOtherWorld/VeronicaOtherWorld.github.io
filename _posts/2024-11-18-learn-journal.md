It's dropped a lot today.  

...so cold.  

But I still keep learning new knowledge.  

The topics of today are code block, final, abstract class and interface. I have not written so much notes, because I was not having a plenty of time...  

At least, I wrote something about interface.

Bravo, not too bad.

Here is the link of the note.
