## Diary of Progress and Reflections  

### The First Snow  
Last Thursday, I experienced the first snow here. It was beautiful and refreshing—a perfect reminder of how every season brings new beginnings and opportunities.  

### Learning Journey  
I’ve been following Han Shunping’s tutorials, going through over 500 lessons. For a long time, I felt stuck, unsure if this method was working for me. However, Teacher Han’s guidance helped me overcome my fears and hesitation, and I’ve gained a lot of knowledge so far.  

That said, time is limited, and I’ve decided to make a change. I’m shifting to another tutorial that focuses on project-based learning. I believe completing projects will give me a stronger sense of accomplishment and help me grow faster.  

### Facing Challenges  
In the new course, the instructor encourages solving LeetCode problems. It’s a real challenge, but I’m optimistic that tackling algorithm problems will build my confidence. Recently, I worked on two examples:  
	•	Palindrome Number Verification  
	•	Division Using Subtraction  
You can find them here: [Code Examples](https://github.com/VeronicaOtherWorld/heima-java/tree/main/src/chapter03_conditon)  

I plan to revisit specific content later, aligning with the pace of my school classes. This way, I can balance both self-learning and formal education.  

### JavaScript Struggles and Progress  
Even though I’ve been using Vue for some time, I still find myself unclear about basic JavaScript concepts, like form parameters and actions. Despite this, I’ve managed to push forward with my projects. I know that with practice and persistence, I’ll improve over time.  

Creating and learning new things truly makes me happy. To keep growing, I’m ready to make bold changes in my approach to learning.  

### New Experiences  
Recently, I tried writing a README file to help others. It was a completely new experience for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope to have more opportunities to explore and try new things like this. You can take a look at my work here: [readme.md](https://github.com/Jim124/Web-Design-CA2/blob/main/README.md)  

### Closing Thoughts  
This diary captures reflections from several days, which is why it might feel a bit scattered. I’m grateful to anyone who reads it and understands that it’s an ongoing journey. Thank you for taking the time to go through my thoughts.
