## Exploring Beginner Algorithms: Challenges, Insights, and the Joy of Problem-Solving  
Today, I worked on four new beginner-level algorithm problems. The experience was truly fascinating. I’m still quite inexperienced and often struggle to write the solutions myself, but I really enjoy the process of racking my brain. The moment I see the instructor’s explanation and suddenly everything clicks—it’s like a whole new world unfolding before me. I’m completely hooked on this feeling.  

### The first problem  
The first problem was about iterating through numbers and calling out “pass” whenever you encounter a number that is 7, contains the digit 7, or is a multiple of 7. 

You can find it here: [Code](https://github.com/VeronicaOtherWorld/java-heima/tree/main/chapter03-condition/src/q3_pass_seven)  


### The second problem  
The second problem was finding the square root of a number. The concept of iterating and comparing to approximate a result is so clever. Even though the problem was simplified, it taught me a lot. I can see how this kind of thinking would be incredibly useful when writing business logic.

This reminds me of something David once said: the most time-consuming part of coding is often dealing with the details, not the overall big picture.  

### The third problem  
The third problem was a number-guessing game. I could actually write the solution for this one, but I sometimes get confused about the exit condition for a while loop. Later, I realized that using a flag variable to handle it works really well. The instructor also introduced a “fallback mechanism,” which made me laugh. It’s exactly what I need when my luck runs out—laughing through the pain.

### The final problem  
The final problem was determining whether a number is a prime number. The code was relatively short, but it really challenged my logical thinking.

I feel so motivated to keep learning and solving more problems. These exercises, though simple, left me with a lot of thoughts today, so I decided to write this study diary to reflect on my progress. Let’s keep moving forward!
