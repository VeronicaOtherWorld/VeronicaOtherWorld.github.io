## Reflection and Learning  
I haven’t updated my study notes for a while, and I feel a bit ashamed about it.  
The first reason is the overwhelming semester-end assignments, which demanded all my attention to present my learning outcomes as perfectly as possible.  

The second reason was the challenge of working on a group project for the first time. Miscommunication and differences in pace and ideas among team members taught me a valuable lesson. Now, I’m determined to only collaborate with people who are on the same wavelength as me in future group projects.  

## Progress and Plans  
As the winter break begins, I plan to continue learning Java.  
Currently, I can use Collection to write a basic management system. Though it’s not perfect, it’s a big encouragement for me.  
I’ve gradually learned how to design and manage classes, and I can write well-organized code with clear responsibilities. I deeply appreciate the abstract concepts taught by my professors, which have guided me toward better design thinking. While classroom knowledge may not immediately lead to elegant code, it equips me with the mindset for good design.  

## Life Updates  
Christmas is approaching again. This year, I went to Jarvis Shopping Centre alone and bought some Christmas gifts there.  
For the new year, I have the same simple wish as always: may everything get better in the coming year.
