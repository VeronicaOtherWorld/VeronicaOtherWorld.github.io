## super good news!

I was so surprised today—I scored 97 in my Software Development course! All the effort I put in was totally worth it. For the assignment, I built a simple advice app based on weather conditions. I couldn’t wait to share the good news with everyone around me. December just got even better!

I’m also continuing my Java course and recently learned how to implement basic CRUD operations in a program. Although it’s fundamental knowledge, I believe in the saying, “No pain, no gain.” I’m confident that this foundation will help me achieve more in the future.

During this short break, I’m planning to dive into operating systems and learn something new in that area.  

I’m enjoying the journey of studying and finding happiness along the way!
