This photo was taken on an Irish night, where the stars shine clear and bright. GPT suggested this could be Orion. Perhaps I am walking through the darkness, but I am grateful for these diamond-like stars lighting my way.

Tomorrow is New Year’s Eve, and time really flies. Recently, I’ve been doing neither too much nor too little. The holidays allowed me to relax a bit, but at the same time, I came to a deep realization that the gaming industry in my country is truly hopeless. Nobody seems to enjoy games anymore: developers fear they won’t make enough money, and players are somehow afraid of games shutting down or being ruined. It feels like some sort of “panic borrowing.” Why can’t we just enjoy games for what they are?

Because of the toxic atmosphere and the constant fear surrounding it, I quickly lost interest and decided to get back to learning.

I need to speed up my progress with Spring and Spring Boot, but I don’t feel like it’s overwhelming. At times, it even feels like they share some similarities with frontend concepts, especially XML. The way XML is written reminds me of various frontend frameworks—it’s almost like a déjà vu.

I’ve also gained a deeper understanding of Maven. Isn’t it just like modules in frontend development? Managing, installing, and developing—it’s quite similar, and this parallel has really helped me grasp these concepts more easily.

At school, we have started learning data structures and algorithms. Initially, I was completely lost, but now I’ve started to get a basic understanding of linked lists. The concepts of elements and pointers really gave me a hard time at first, but thankfully, I’m gradually getting the hang of it, and I even find it quite interesting!

With the real New Year arriving, I feel like I should start writing journals and study logs to keep myself accountable. So in the days ahead, I’ll make an effort to think more and update regularly!
