Lately, I’ve been busy preparing for various exams and assignments. It feels quite painful, but maybe this is proof that I’m truly studying hard. After all, encountering and absorbing new knowledge is always uncomfortable at first.

But life still needs to be recorded properly. Seeing my own growth through steady progress is the best part of it all.

I’ve also gained a deeper understanding of data structures, especially singly linked lists. At this point, I can write code that runs smoothly.

I also built a small project to help myself learn and explore React more deeply. This project integrates Google APIs—users enter multiple addresses, and the app generates an optimized route. If needed, they can also open Google Maps for further details. The main users are me and delivery drivers; we can quickly plan delivery routes and check real-time traffic conditions. The customization comes from setting the starting point as a restaurant and restricting the map area to Ireland, so there’s no need to worry about incorrect route planning when searching for new addresses.

This project is designed to be used instantly—just open and go. It’s currently deployed on GitHub.

Honestly, its practical value isn’t that high, but I just enjoy sharing my development journey with others.

A project that might be more useful to the general public is a price comparison tool. Users enter products of the same category along with their prices, and the app calculates the unit price, making it easier to choose the most cost-effective option. Comparing prices while grocery shopping is one of my quirky little hobbies.

After letting some friends try it, they suggested adding a barcode scanning feature. I think it’s a great idea since every small tool’s ultimate purpose is to satisfy human laziness.

However, I’ll probably start working on that next month, since the beginning of this month is packed with exams, assignments, and catch-up lessons. I’m currently using GitHub Projects to plan and organize features and development steps, hoping to keep myself on track.

The most basic version is already deployed. Would this count as agile development? First, we build a bicycle, then eventually an airplane. The feeling of applying what I’ve learned is truly satisfying.

Every day, I feel like there’s never enough time—so many things to do! But instead of stressing over it, it’s better to just get things done. Let’s keep pushing forward together!
